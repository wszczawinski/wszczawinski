# Hi, I'm Wojtek ðŸ‘‹


I am a young passionate engineer who is not afraid to learn and get to know new technologies and also likes this process. 

Being able to think of ways to solve a problem and create things useful for other people gives me a sense of fulfillment. I consider it the most important because applying this mindset in different projects only requires the use of different tools.
